# Distribution Network Analysis: Capacity Planning for Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption
## Business Understanding
### Project Overview
Distribution Network Analysis in the energy industry refers to the process of studying and evaluating the electrical distribution networks that deliver electricity from high-voltage transmission lines to end-users, such as homes, businesses, and industrial facilities. 
This analysis becomes even more critical with the rise of EVs, as it transforms the energy landscape. 

The project aims to achieve the following objectives:

-Assess Network Capacity: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the distribution network's current capacity to handle increased load from EV charging stations.
-Identify Bottlenecks: Identify potential bottlenecks and vulnerabilities within the distribution network that could hinder reliable electricity delivery to EV charging stations.
-Optimize Network Upgrades: Develop a data-driven strategy for network upgrades that maximizes efficiency, minimizes costs, and ensures grid reliability.

### Business Problem
PowerCharge Utilities encounters several critical challenges due to the growing adoption of electric vehicles:

- Increased Load Demand: Widespread EV adoption has caused a significant spike in electricity demand, particularly during peak charging times. This strains the existing distribution network infrastructure.
- Grid Overloads: Frequent overloads in the distribution network leads to voltage fluctuations and outages in specific areas, affecting overall grid reliability.
- Customer Satisfaction: EV owners expect reliable and convenient charging services. Ensuring this level of service is essential to maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- Cost Management: Balancing increased load demands and grid reliability comes at a significant cost. PowerCharge Utilities must optimize network investments to manage expenses effectively.

## Insights
1. <b>Electric consumption:</b> The electricity consumption is mostly centered around 500 kWh, with certain instances of high consumption. This indicates varied demand at different times and locations.
2. <b>EV Types and Charging Habits:</b> Electric scooters are the most common types of EVs. Most customers charge their EVs daily. Indicating a consistent daily load on the distribution network.
3. <b>Consumer Type:</b> Most Customers are commercial customers.
4. <b>Geospatial Distribution:</b> The spatial distribution of substations and EV charging stations is widespread.
5. <b>Geospatial Distribution:</b> The EV charging stations seems to be too far from their corresponding substation.
6. <b>Network Capacity:</b> Some substations have a high consumption to capacity ratio indicating potential bottlenecks and overloads in the network. There is also no correlation with the 
   number of EVs per substation and the consumption to capacity ratio, this shows that Number of EVs is not a factor for overload.
7. <b>Weather Correlation:</b> The correlation between weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) and electricity consumption is weak in the current dataset suggesting that other factors
   might be more influential in affecting electricity consumption.

## Recommendations
1. <b>Prioritize Substation Upgrades:</b> Prioritize upgrades at substations where the Consumption_to_Capacity_Ratio is high, indicating potential overloads. Upgrade the transmission lines
   because the EV Charging Stations are too far from their corresponding substations.  
   
2. <b>Geospatial Analysis for Upgrading Planning:</b> Use geospatial to determine the optimal locations for new substations or upgrades to existing ones. Consider factors like the proximity to high load demand areas (areas with high consumption to capacity ratio) and geographical constraints.

3. <b>Demand Side Management: </b> Implement demand-side management strategies to balance the load on the grid. Encourage customers to charge their EVs during off-peak hours through incentives or dynamic pricing.

4. <b>Advanced Monitoring and Analysis: </b> Deploy advanced monitoring systems to continuously monitor the health and performance of the distribution network. Use analytics to predict potential issues and take preventive action.

5. <b>Cost-Benefit Analysis: </b> Conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis for different upgrade options. Consider factors like the cost of upgrades, operational costs, potential revenue from increased capacity and the impact on service reliability and customer satisfaction.

6. <b>Customer Engagement: </b> Engage with customers to understand their needs and expectations. Provide clear communication about network upgrades and how they will enhance service reliability and meet the growing demand for EV charging. 

7. <b>Continuous Improvement: </b> Continuously monitor and assess the performance of the distribution network. Gather feedback from customers and other stakeholders and use this feedback to make further improvements and optimizations.

By following these steps, PowerCharge Utilities can develop an effective optimization strategy to manage the increased load demand from EV charging stations, ensure the reliability and 
resilience of the distribution network and meet the expectations of customers, all while optimizing costs and ensuring regulatory compliance.
